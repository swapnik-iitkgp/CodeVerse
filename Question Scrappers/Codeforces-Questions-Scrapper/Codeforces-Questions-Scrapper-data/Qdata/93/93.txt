You are given two integers
n
and
k
.
An array
a1,a2,…,an
of length
n
, consisting of zeroes and ones is good if for all integers
i
from
1
to
n
both of the following conditions are satisfied:
at least
⌈
i
k
⌉
of the first
i
elements of
a
are equal to
1
,
at least
⌈
i
k
⌉
of the last
i
elements of
a
are equal to
1
.
Here,
⌈
i
k
⌉
denotes the result of division of
i
by
k
, rounded up. For example,
⌈
6
3
⌉=2
,
⌈
11
5
⌉=⌈2.2⌉=3
and
⌈
7
4
⌉=⌈1.75⌉=2
.
Find the minimum possible number of ones in a good array.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
k
(
2≤n≤100
,
1≤k≤n
) — the length of array and parameter
k
from the statement.
Output
For each test case output one integer — the minimum possible number of ones in a good array.
It can be shown that under the given constraints at least one good array always exists.

Note
In the first test case,
n=3
and
k=2
:
Array
[1,0,1]
is good and the number of ones in it is
2
.
Arrays
[0,0,0]
,
[0,1,0]
and
[0,0,1]
are not good since for
i=1
the first condition from the statement is not satisfied.
Array
[1,0,0]
is not good since for
i=1
the second condition from the statement is not satisfied.
All other arrays of length
3
contain at least
2
ones.
Thus, the answer is
2
.
In the second test case,
n=5
and
k=2
:
Array
[1,1,0,0,1]
is not good since for
i=3
the second condition is not satisfied.
Array
[1,0,1,0,1]
is good and the number of ones in it is
3
.
It can be shown that there is no good array with less than
3
ones, so the answer is
3
.
In the third test case,
n=9
and
k=3
:
Array
[1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
is good and the number of ones in it is
4
.
It can be shown that there is no good array with less than
4
ones, so the answer is
4
.
In the fourth test case,
n=7
and
k=1
. The only good array is
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
, so the answer is
7
.
