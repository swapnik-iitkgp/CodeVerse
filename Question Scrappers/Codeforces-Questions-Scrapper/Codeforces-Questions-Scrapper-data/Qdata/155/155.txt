Mr. Chanek opened a letter from his fellow, who is currently studying at Singanesia. Here is what it says.
Define an array
b
(
0≤bi<k
) with
n
integers. While there exists a pair
(i,j)
such that
bi≠bj
, do the following operation:
Randomly pick a number
i
satisfying
0≤i<n
. Note that each number
i
has a probability of
1
n
to be picked.
Randomly Pick a number
j
satisfying
0≤j<k
.
Change the value of
bi
to
j
. It is possible for
bi
to be changed to the same value.
Denote
f(b)
as the expected number of operations done to
b
until all elements of
b
are equal.
You are given two integers
n
and
k
, and an array
a
(
−1≤ai<k
) of
n
integers.
For every index
i
with
ai=−1
, replace
ai
with a random number
j
satisfying
0≤j<k
. Let
c
be the number of occurrences of
−1
in
a
. There are
kc
possibilites of
a
after the replacement, each with equal probability of being the final array.
Find the expected value of
f(a)
modulo
109+7
.
Formally, let
M=109+7
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}
. Output the integer equal to
p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M
. In other words, output such an integer
x
that
0 \le x < M
and
x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}
.
After reading the letter, Mr. Chanek gave the task to you. Solve it for the sake of their friendship!
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2 \leq n \leq 10^5
,
2 \leq k \leq 10^9
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(
-1 \leq a_i < k
).
Output
Output an integer denoting the expected value of
f(a)
modulo
10^9 + 7
.
